    <h1>The Best Anime According to me!</h1>
    <p>(don't skip it!!!)<p>
    <h2>My Top 3 Anime are::<hr></h2>
    <h3>Your name</h3>
    <p>It is, you guessed it, an anime movie with beautiful visuals.
        but be ready to shed some tears. It doesn't have a bad ending though.</p>
    <h3>Eminence in Shadow</h3>
    <p>Remember the times as a kid you used to get excited over useless dialogue 
        and binge watch the episodes of your favorite anime. Now that you have matured(which i don't believe)
        you find it cringe. Yeah it is that kind of anime, the visuals are once agein beautiful
        and mc is dense but has a wierd personality
    </p>
    <h3>Relife</h3>
    <p>Relife is a comedy/slice of life anime. the visuals are not that appealing
        but they are not bad either. It is a roller coster of emotions.
